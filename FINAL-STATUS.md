# ✅ Website Setup - Final Status

**Date**: November 10, 2025
**Status**: DNS Propagation in Progress

---

## 🎉 What's Complete

### ✅ GitHub Setup (100%)
- GitHub account created: [@akritpoudel](https://github.com/akritpoudel)
- Repository: [github.com/akritpoudel/akritpoudel.com.np](https://github.com/akritpoudel/akritpoudel.com.np)
- GitHub Pages enabled and built
- Custom domain `akritpoudel.com.np` configured

### ✅ Website Content (100%)
- Professional aviation-themed design
- Complete CV with all experience, skills, and certifications
- Responsive mobile design
- Aircraft flight animations
- All content for Akrit Poudel - Licensed Aircraft Engineer B1.1

### ✅ DNS Configuration (100%)
- All 6 DNS records added to Cloudflare:
  - 4 A records pointing to GitHub
  - 1 CNAME record for www
  - 1 TXT record for verification
- **Proxy status changed to "DNS only"** (CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED)

---

## ⏳ What's Happening Now

### DNS Propagation in Progress

You just changed the Cloudflare proxy status from "Proxied" (orange) to "DNS only" (gray). This was the correct fix, but now DNS needs time to propagate with the new settings.

**Timeline:**
- **Minimum**: 10-30 minutes
- **Typical**: 1-2 hours
- **Maximum**: 24 hours

**What's happening automatically:**
1. DNS spreading across the internet
2. GitHub will detect and verify your domain
3. SSL certificate will be issued automatically
4. HTTPS will enable automatically

## 🌐 Your Website URLs

### Currently Working:
✅ **https://akritpoudel.github.io/akritpoudel.com.np/**
(This URL works RIGHT NOW and will always work)

### Will Work Soon (after DNS propagates):
⏳ **http://akritpoudel.com.np**
⏳ **http://www.akritpoudel.com.np**
⏳ **https://akritpoudel.com.np** (after GitHub verification)
⏳ **https://www.akritpoudel.com.np** (after GitHub verification)

## 🔍 How to Check Progress

### Method 1: Check DNS Propagation
Visit: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/akritpoudel.com.np

When you see green checkmarks with the GitHub IPs (185.199.108.153, etc.), DNS has propagated.

### Method 2: Try Your Domain
Just try visiting http://akritpoudel.com.np in your browser every 30 minutes.

### Method 3: Check GitHub Pages
Visit: https://github.com/akritpoudel/akritpoudel.com.np/settings/pages

When you see "DNS check successful" and a green checkmark, it's ready!

## 📊 Current Status Details

### GitHub Pages Status:
```json
{
  "status": "built",
  "cname": "akritpoudel.com.np",
  "html_url": "http://akritpoudel.com.np/",
  "protected_domain_state": "unverified",
  "https_enforced": false
}
```

**Translation:**
- ✅ Website is built and ready
- ✅ Custom domain is configured
- ⏳ Domain verification pending (waiting for DNS)
- ⏳ HTTPS will enable after verification

---

## ✨ What You Don't Need to Do

**Nothing!** Everything is configured correctly. Just wait for:

1. DNS to propagate (automatic)
2. GitHub to verify domain (automatic)
3. HTTPS certificate to be issued (automatic)

---

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

### Within 1-2 Hours:
- DNS should be fully propagated
- HTTP version (http://akritpoudel.com.np) should work
- GitHub should verify domain ownership

### Within 2-4 Hours:
- HTTPS should be enabled
- https://akritpoudel.com.np should work with green padlock
- Everything fully operational

## 📞 If You Need Help

If after 24 hours the custom domain still doesn't work:

1. Check Cloudflare DNS settings are still "DNS only" (gray cloud)
2. Visit GitHub Pages settings and look for error messages
3. Try removing and re-adding the custom domain in GitHub settings

## 📁 Repository Files

All your website files are in:
- [index.html](index.html) - Main website
- [styles.css](styles.css) - Aviation-themed styling
- [script.js](script.js) - Animations and interactivity
- [CNAME](CNAME) - Domain configuration

---

## 🚀 Summary

**Everything is set up correctly!**

You've completed all the manual configuration steps. The website is live on GitHub Pages and is just waiting for DNS to propagate globally. Once that happens (1-4 hours), your custom domain will work automatically with HTTPS.

**Working URL Now:**
https://akritpoudel.github.io/akritpoudel.com.np/

**Custom Domain Soon:**
https://akritpoudel.com.np
